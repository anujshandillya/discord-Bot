- `.level`: It is a command that allows users to check their or other users' levels within a leveling system. To implement a leveling system in your Discord bot, you'll need to track users' experience points (XP) and levels.
  
-  `.levelreset`: It is a command used to reset a user's level and experience points (XP) back to a certain starting point or zero.

- `.me`: It allows users to view their own profile information or personal statistics within a server or community. This command can provide users with information about their username, avatar, roles, join date, or any other relevant data you want to display.

- `.mem`: It used to provide users with information about the another member's  personal statistics within a server or community.

- `.play`: It  is  used to make the bot join a voice channel and play audio, such as music or sound effects.

- `.join`: It is used to make the bot join a voice channel in a Discord server. This command allows the bot to connect to a voice channel so that it can participate in voice-related activities, such as playing music, relaying audio, or responding to voice commands.

- `.leave`: It is used to make the bot leave a voice channel in a Discord server. This command allows the bot to disconnect from a voice channel when it's no longer needed.

- `.ping`: It is a common and simple command that allows you to measure the bot's latency or response time. Users can invoke the command, and the bot responds with the time it takes for a message to be sent and received.
