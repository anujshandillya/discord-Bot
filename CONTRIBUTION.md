## Getting Started

- Make sure you have Python and Discord.py installed on your system.
- Clone the repository and set up a virtual environment if needed:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-bot.git
   cd your-bot
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Setting up Your Discord Bot

1. **Create a New Discord Bot:**

   Start by creating a new Discord bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Follow these steps:

   - Log in to your Discord account.
   - Go to the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
   - Click the "New Application" button.
   - Give your application a name, and then navigate to the "Bot" tab.
   - Click the "Add Bot" button to create a bot user for your application.

2. **Obtain a Bot Token:**

   After creating your bot, you'll need to obtain a bot token. Here's how:

   - On the "Bot" tab, you'll find the "Token" section. Click the "Copy" button to copy your bot token to your clipboard.

3. **Configure Your Bot:**

   - In your bot's project directory, locate the `config.example.json` file.
   - Copy this file and rename it to `config.json`.
   - Open the `config.json` file in a text editor.
   - Inside `config.json`, you'll typically find a section where you can paste your bot token. It may look something like this:

     ```json
     {
       "token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE",
       "other_config_option": "other_value"
     }
     ```

   - Replace `"YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"` with the bot token you copied earlier.
   - Fill in any other necessary configuration details as required by your bot.

   Your bot is now configured with the token you obtained from the Discord Developer Portal. You can use this token to authenticate and interact with the Discord API.

## Submitting Issues

## Push Your Branch to Your Forked Repository

Once your changes are committed locally, you should push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub. To do this, follow these steps:

1. **Push Your Branch:**

   Use the following Git command to push your local branch to your forked repository on GitHub. Be sure to replace `feature-name` with the actual name of your branch:
